    "* 📌 Características:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Basado en BERT-base\n",
    "  * Preentrenado con Whole Word Masking (WWM)\n",
    "  * No distingue entre mayúsculas y minúsculas (`uncased`)\n",

    "* Importa dos clases de la biblioteca `transformers`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `AutoTokenizer`: se encarga de convertir texto en **tokens numéricos** que el modelo puede entender.\n",
